# Chemical Chatbot Architectures and ChemBench Evaluation

This repository contains five distinct architectures designed for building a chemical chatbot using a large language model and a test framework to quantitatively measure the impact the architectures have on the chemical capabilities of the LLM.
The architectures differ by the components they use including external knowledge databases, reasoning approaches and chain/workflow configurations. 
An extensive chatbot backbone using endpoints as configured in this repo can be found at:
